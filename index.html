		<h2> What is FSY? </h2>
		<p>“Rise up and become a person you’re designed to be” –Dieter F. Uchtdorf. </p>
		<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints prepared an event that changed a youth’s life.
		FSY or For the Strength of Youth is a 5-day, overnight event that happens once every 20 years.
		The event took place last July 2-7 2018 at Crown Legacy Hotel, Baguio City. Youths from Agoo, Baguio, 
		San Fernando and Bauang ages 14-18 were the lucky once to experience a life changing event. This event mainly 
		focuses on the youth’s spiritual needs, on how youth’s can be more like Christ and on how “Come unto Christ”. Classes, 
		Musical Devotionals, Games, Talent Show and more activities are waiting for these Future Missionaries. </p>

<div class="day1">
	
	<div class="one">
		<p> July 2 marks the day when youths have to leave their phones, tablets and other gadgets on their respective houses 
		to focus and prepare for FSY. Right after you exit the bus, the warm smiling faces of the counselors greets you as they 
		dance with the music. Backpacks, Handbooks and Pens were distributed as the youths gather ‘round the function hall. While
		waiting for others to arrive, the counselors prepared mini games for the youths to not get bored on the first day. 
		Orientations of the whole event and the Big Five rules were discussed thoroughly making sure that everyone understands.
		The youths then met their Counselor and Company group that will serve as their team mates throughout the whole week. Then
		it was followed by the assigning of rooms. </p>

			<p> Since the youths wanted to become missonaries of Christ, the counselors are now training
			them on how to become one. They gave lessons, manners that needs to be followed and how to introduce 
			the gospel to them. This helps them to help people who are in need both physically and most importantly,
			spiritually. The highlight of the week finally came that everyone was looking forward to...
			The Games Night and Cheer-Offs!!. Different companies came up with their names, practiced their yell
			and made their banners to showcase their own companies. This is where youths showed their team work and
			cooperation with one another to prove that who’s team is the best of all. After all those exhausting games,
			Favorite Food Night came next that surely satisfied the tummies of the youths.  </p>
